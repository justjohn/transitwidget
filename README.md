## Transit Widget

This project is devoted to the development of transitwidget, an open source android app that displays bus stop prediction information from NextBus. Deploy the transitwidget to your home screen, then configure the agency, route, stop that you are interested in. transitwidget displays the time the next bus is predicted to be at that stop.
