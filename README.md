## TransitWidget

This project is devoted to the development of transitwidget, an open source android app that displays bus stop prediction information from NextBus. Deploy the transitwidget to your home screen, then configure the agency, route, stop that you are interested in. transitwidget displays the time the next bus is predicted to be at that stop.

### Building TransitWidget

In order to build TransitWidget you need to setup the Android projects of both TransitWidget and it's dependencies for your machine. This involves running the provided `init.sh` script or `android update project` on the project directory and all libraries in `deps`.

## Acknowledgments

TransitWidget uses the excellent [HoloEverywhere](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere) and [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/) libraries.
